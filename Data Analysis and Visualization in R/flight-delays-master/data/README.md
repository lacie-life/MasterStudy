# Case Study I: Flight Delays

This repository contains a R project for the course Data Analysis and Visualization in R for the year 2019/2020 at Technical University of Munich.

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. 

Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations. 

The dataset is available on Kaggle.

The goal of the project is giving a presentation to show interesting patterns in the data.
