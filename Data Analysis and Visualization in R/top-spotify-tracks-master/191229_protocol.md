# Top Spotify Tracks - Case Study II
## Protocol of first meeting on 19.12.2019

### What we want to do
Focus on Dataset 2 (maybe include Dataset 1 in analysis as well)

### Questions we want to answer
- Can you predict what is the rank position or the number of streams a song will have in the future? [Axel]
- Are people listening to the very same top ranking songs on countries far away from each other? [Yun]
- How long does songs "resist" on the top 3, 5, 10, 20 ranking? [Timo]
- "Insert question here" (Combine Dataset 1 and 2 to find out what defines great songs) [Ila]
