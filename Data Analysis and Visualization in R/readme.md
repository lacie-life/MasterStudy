This folder contains lecture notes from the course as well as the two grade bonus projects. Projects were made in collaboration with Timo Angerer, Yun Fei Xsu and Axel Vargas, and were originally in their own GitHub repository which has been moved inside the TUM master one. 

These projects are meant to be used in compliance with the TUM Code of Conduct and therefore not be copied.
