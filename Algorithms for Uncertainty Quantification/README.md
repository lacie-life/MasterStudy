# About these notes
These notes are my lecture notes on the Algorithms for Uncertainty Quantification course held in the summer term 2021 by Dr. Tobias Neckel. The notes are based on the course slides [^1]. Images are taken from the course slides.

The notes are written in [Obsidian markdown](https://obsidian.md/) and are best viewed in Obsidian.

I left out the first two lectures because these only contained an overview of UQ and a repetition of probability theory.
