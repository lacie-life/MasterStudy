# 2 Singular Value Decomposition
## 2.1 Principal Components
Assume a $n$-dim. random vector $X$, $E(X) = 0$.

#### Variance in Direction
Let $||v||=1$ be some direction vector. $\langle X, v\rangle$ gives the proportion of $X$ in direction $v$. Thus the variance in direction $v$ is: $E(\langle X, v\rangle^2)$ (square because of 0-centered $X$).

Empirically, $X$ is represented by samples in a matrix $M_X$ (rows = realizations). Our goal is now to maximize $||M_X v||_2$ over $v$.
