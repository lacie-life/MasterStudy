### Theorems
- Sen's Theorem
- Schwartz' characterization of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$
- (Arrow, 1959): transitively rationalizable <=> $\alpha$ + $\beta^+$
- anonymity + neutrality => not (resolute for an arbitrary number of voters and alternatives)
- (Moulin 1983): $\exists$ anonymous, neutral and PO <=> n cannot be divided by any $2 \leq q \leq m$.
- resoluteness + monotonicity + 2 alternatives => strategyproof
- May's Theorem
- Condorcet(-May) paradox
- Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
- Field Expansion Lemma, Group Contraction Lemma
- Variants of Arrovian Impossibility Results
- Arrow's Theorem holds for strict preferences
- transitive-in-domain $R_M$ --> $\max$-SCF satisfies strategy-proofness and participation in that domain
- (Inada, 1964) $R_M$ transitive on dichotomous preferences
- (Black, Arrow) $R_M$ transitive on single-peaked preferences
- (Sen & Pattanaik) $R_M$ transitive exactly on the value-restricted domains
- scoring rules invariant under positive affine transformations
- scoring rule monotonic <==> score vector monotonic (given enough voters)
- Scoring rules are not Condorcet extensions
- (Smith, 1973) Condorcet winners are never Borda losers; Condorcet losers are never Borda winners
- (Gehrlein, 1978) Borda's rule among all scoring rules maximizes the probability of choosing a Condorcet winner, if it exists
- (Smith; Young) Neutral + anon. SCF is a composed scoring rule iff it satisfies reinforcment
- (Young, 1974) Borda's rule is the unique SCF satisfying neutrality, Pareto-optimality, reinforcement and cancellation
- (Young & Levenglick 1978) No Condorcet extension satisfies reinforcement when $m \geq 3$
- Condorcet Jury theorem: for two alternatives, majority rule is the maximum likelihood SCF
- (Young 1988) For $p$ close to 0.5, Borda's rule is the maximum likelihood SCF
- (Young 1988) Kemeny's rule is the maximum-likelihood SPF for any $p$
- (Young & Levenglick 1978) Kemeny's rule is the only neutral SPF that satisfies Condorcet consistency and reinforcement
- (Young 1988) Kemeny's rule is the only SPF that satisfies anonymity, neutrality, Pareto optimality, reinforcement and LIIA
- (McGarvey, 1953) Every majority graph (with 1 on every edge) can be induced by a preference profile with an odd number of voters
- Kemeny Ranking hardness results
	- FAS is NP complete (even if restricted to tournaments)
	- (Bartholdi 1989) Kemeny Ranking decision problem is NP-complete
	- (Dwork 2001) Finding a Kemeny ranking is NP-hard for $n \in \{4, 6, 7, 8, \dots\}$
	- deciding for a ranking if it is a Kemeny ranking is coNP-complete
	- deciding whether a given alternative is a Kemeny winner is $\Theta_2^P$-complete
	- FAS is APX-hard (cannot be approximated efficiently); However, there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme for weighted tournament FAS.

- Computing $TEQ$ is NP-hard
- Schwartz' conjecture is false
- set-rationalizability <=> $\hat{\alpha}$
- many SCFs violate $\hat{\alpha}$:
	- non-trivial monotonic scoring rules violate $\hat{\alpha}$
	- almost all other rules we studied: instant-runoff, plurality with runoff, Baldwin's rule, Black's rule, Kemeny's rule, maximin, Young's rule, Copeland's rule, uncovered set, Banks set
- $TC$ satisfies both $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$
- every tournament has a unique optimal probability distribution
- $BP$ and optimal probability distribution properties
	- $p(x) > 0$ iff $u_p(x) = 0$
	- $|BP(A, P_M)|$ is odd
	- $p(x)$ is the quotient of odd numbers or 0

- any monotonic scoring rule satisfies participation
- a resolute SCF an two alternatives is strategyproof iff it is monotonic
- in any domain with $R_M$ acyclic, $Max(R_M, A)$ satisfies strategproofness and participation
- strong monotonicity implies monotonicity
- a resolute SCF is strongly monotonic iff any single voter can move around the alternatives below the winning alternative without changing the result

- (Gibbard 1977) The only non-imposing, non-manipulable SDS for $m \geq 3$ are random dictatorships
- (Barberà 1979) There are probabilistic variants of Borda's rule and Copeland's rule that are non-manipulable
- (Kreweras 1965; Fishburn 1984) Maximal lotteries "essentially pick a randomized Condorcet winner"
- A unique maximal lottery always exists
- Maximal lotteries are Condorcet extensions, Pareto optimal, monotonic, satisfy reinforcement, participation, etc. etc... (all the good properties!)
